# Model Metadata Viewer

A web-based tool to explore and compare machine learning models from Hugging Face and Ollama.

## Overview

The Model Metadata Viewer provides a user-friendly interface to browse, search, and filter machine learning models from different sources. It currently supports:

- **Hugging Face Models**: Public models from the Hugging Face Hub
- **Ollama Installed Models**: Models currently installed in your local Ollama instance
- **Ollama Available Models**: Models available for download from the Ollama library

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`
- For Ollama models: A running Ollama server (for installed models)
- For Hugging Face models: Internet connection to fetch model data

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. Run the appropriate script to generate metadata files (see below)

## Generating Metadata Files

### 1. Hugging Face Models

```bash
python src/utils/load_huggingface_metadata.py
```

This will create `open_models_data.json` in the current directory with metadata for public Hugging Face models.

### 2. Ollama Installed Models

Make sure your Ollama server is running, then:

```bash
python src/utils/load_ollama_metadata.py
```

This will create `ollama_models_data.json` with metadata for your locally installed Ollama models.

### 3. Ollama Available Models

```bash
python src/utils/load_ollama_all_metadata.py
```

This will create `ollama_available_models.json` with metadata for all models available in the Ollama library.

## Using the Viewer

1. Open `model_metadata_viewer.html` in a web browser
2. Use the dropdown to select the model source:
   - Hugging Face
   - Ollama (Installed)
   - Ollama (Available)
3. Use the search box to filter models by name/ID
4. Use the pipeline filter to show only specific model types
5. Click "Sort by Score" to sort models by their benchmark scores (Hugging Face only)

## Features

- **Search**: Find models by name or ID
- **Filter**: Filter by pipeline type (e.g., text-generation, image-classification)
- **Sorting**: Sort models by benchmark scores (where available)
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline**: Once data is downloaded, works without internet connection

## File Structure

- `model_metadata_viewer.html` - The main viewer interface
- `open_models_data.json` - Generated by `load_huggingface_metadata.py`
- `ollama_models_data.json` - Generated by `load_ollama_metadata.py`
- `ollama_available_models.json` - Generated by `load_ollama_all_metadata.py`

## Notes

- For Hugging Face models, only public models are included by default
- The viewer loads all data client-side, so very large model collections may impact performance
- Benchmark scores are only available for some Hugging Face models
