# 4. Run Pipelines: MongoDB, Download PDFs, Neo4j, and Qdrant Pipelines

   *pipelines do not have to run in order if you have previously run them or starting where you left off

   *recommended to run them in order for processing new papers
   ## a. Run sync_mongodb pipeline to fetch papers from ArXiv API and store in MongoDB:
   ```bash
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   $env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/onfig"
   python -m src.pipeline.sync_mongodb --config config/default.yaml
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build sync-mongodb
   ```

   ## b. Run sync-neo4j pipeline for new pdf metadata inserted from MongoDB:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build sync-neo4j
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   $env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/onfig"
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   python -m src.graph.sync_mongo_to_neo4j
   ```
   
   ## c. Run download_pdfs pipeline to download PDFs from arxiv.org using metadata stored in MongoDB:
   ```bash
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   $env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/onfig"
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   python -m src.utils.download_pdfs
   ```
   
   ## d. Run sync_qdrant pipeline to process downloaded PDFs and store as vector embeddings in Qdrant:
   ```bash
   python -m src.pipeline.sync_qdrant
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build sync-qdrant
   ```
   
   **New Feature:** The sync_qdrant pipeline now includes **MongoDB tracking** to prevent duplicate processing of PDFs. Each processed PDF is recorded in the `processed_pdfs` collection with metadata including file hash, processing date, and chunk count.
   
   Note: set "MONGO_URI" env var to "mongodb://mongodb:27017/" for docker pipelines
   ```bash
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   $env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://mongodb:27017/"
   echo $env:MONGO_URI
   ```

## 5. Web UI
   To restart Web UI docker service, starts with docker-compose up above:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d web-ui
   ```
   Access the web interface at: http://localhost:3000

### Web UI Development Setup

The web interface uses React with the Neo4j JavaScript driver. If you want to develop the web UI locally:

1. **Navigate to the web-ui directory**:
   ```bash
   cd src/web-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies including Neo4j JavaScript driver**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # Or to install Neo4j driver specifically:
   npm install neo4j-driver@5.13.0
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The web UI connects to Neo4j using environment variables defined in the docker-compose.yml file. For local development, you can create a `.env.local` file in the src/web-ui directory with the appropriate Neo4j connection details.

### Configuration
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d68b38e-b4a1-49d9-acf4-17b74fb05e22)

The application is configured using YAML files in the `config/` directory. The default configuration is in `config/default.yaml`.

Key configuration options:

## Recent Feature Additions

### 1. MongoDB Tracking for Qdrant Vector Processing

The sync_qdrant pipeline now includes a tracking system to prevent duplicate processing and provide synchronization with Qdrant:

```yaml
# In config/default.yaml
qdrant:
  # ... other settings ...
  tracking:
    enabled: true # Whether to track processed PDFs
    collection_name: "processed_pdfs" # MongoDB collection to store tracking information
    sync_with_qdrant: true # Whether to sync tracking with actual Qdrant contents
```

This system:
- Tracks each processed PDF in a MongoDB collection
- Prevents duplicate processing of the same document
- Stores metadata including file hash, processing date, and chunk count
- Maintains consistency between MongoDB tracking and Qdrant vector storage

### 2. GPU Acceleration for Vector Operations

The pipeline now supports GPU acceleration for both:

#### A. Qdrant Vector Database
```yaml
# In config/default.yaml
qdrant:
  # ... other settings ...
  gpu_enabled: true # Enable GPU for vector operations
  gpu_device: 1 # GPU device index (0 for first GPU, 1 for second, etc.)
```

#### B. Standalone Qdrant with GPU
For better performance with large vector collections, you can run Qdrant as a standalone application with GPU support as documented in the "Qdrant Deployment Options" section.

## PDF Storage Location
To change where PDFs are stored, edit the pdf_storage.directory in the config:

```yaml
# In config/default.yaml
pdf_storage:
  directory: E:/AI Research
```

The `sync_qdrant` pipeline uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for analyzing images extracted from PDFs if available:

- **What Ollama does**: Enhances the vector database by adding AI-generated descriptions of diagrams and figures in papers
- **Installation**: Download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
- **Required model**: Run `ollama pull llama3` to download the required model
- **Without Ollama**: The pipeline still functions normally without Ollama, but image descriptions will be placeholders

## ArXiv Pipeline Configuration Settings
The system is configured through `config/default.yaml`. Key configuration sections include:

### Ollama Integration (Optional)

The `sync_qdrant` pipeline uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) for analyzing images extracted from PDFs if available:

- **What Ollama does**: Enhances the vector database by adding AI-generated descriptions of diagrams and figures in papers
- **Installation**: Download and install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
- **Required model**: Run `ollama pull llama3` to download the required model
- **Without Ollama**: The pipeline still functions normally without Ollama, but image descriptions will be placeholders

### Important Note About PDF Paths in Docker

When running the `sync_qdrant` service in Docker, the PDF directory path specified in `config/default.yaml` is overridden by the volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - E:/AI Research:/app/data/pdfs  # Maps Windows path to container path
```

This means:
- Your PDFs should be stored in `E:/AI Research` on your Windows machine
- Inside the Docker container, they will be accessible at `/app/data/pdfs`
- The script automatically detects when running in Docker and adjusts paths accordingly

If you change your PDF storage location, make sure to update both:
1. The `pdf_storage.directory` in `config/default.yaml` (for local runs)
2. The volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml` (for Docker runs)
   ## sync_mongodb pipeline
   - arxiv.categories: Research categories to fetch papers from api into mongodb
   - arxiv.max_results: Number of papers to fetch per API call
   - arxiv.rate_limit_seconds: Number of seconds to wait between API calls
   - arxiv.max_iterations: Number of API calls per category
   - arxiv.start_date: Only process papers published after this date
   - arxiv.end_date: Only process papers published before this date

   ## sync_neo4j pipeline
   - arxiv.process_categories: Categories to prioritize for vector storage into qdrant
   - arxiv.max_papers: Maximum number of papers to process
   - arxiv.max_papers_per_category: Maximum number of papers to download per category
   - arxiv.sort_by: Sort papers by this field
   - arxiv.sort_order: Sort papers in this order

   ## sync_qdrant pipeline
   - arxiv.max_papers: Maximum number of papers to process
   - arxiv.max_papers_per_category: Maximum number of papers to download per category
   - arxiv.sort_by: Sort papers by this field
   - arxiv.sort_order: Sort papers in this order

   ## download_pdfs pipeline
   - arxiv.max_papers: Maximum number of papers to process
   - arxiv.max_papers_per_category: Maximum number of papers to download per category
   - arxiv.sort_by: Sort papers by this field
   - arxiv.sort_order: Sort papers in this order

Config changes take effect when services are restarted. See `docs/system_design.md` for detailed information about configuration impact on system behavior.

## Qdrant Deployment Options

This pipeline supports two options for running Qdrant (vector database):

### Option 1: Running Qdrant in Docker (Default)

In the `docker-compose.yml` file, we provide a pre-configured Qdrant container:

```yaml
qdrant:
  image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
  ports:
    - "6333:6333"
    - "6334:6334"
  volumes:
    - qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage
  restart: unless-stopped
```

### Option 2: Running Qdrant Locally with GPU Support

For better performance with large vector collections, you can run Qdrant as a standalone application with GPU acceleration:

1. **Download Qdrant** from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases)

2. **Create a config file** at `config/qdrant_config.yaml` with GPU settings:

```yaml
storage:
  # Path to the directory where collections will be stored
  storage_path: ./storage
  
  # Vector data configuration with GPU support
  vector_data:
    # Enable CUDA support
    enable_cuda: true
    
    # GPU device index (0 for first GPU, 1 for second, etc.)
    cuda_device: 0
```

3. **Run Qdrant with the config**:
```
qdrant.exe --config-path config/qdrant_config.yaml
```

4. **Update the docker-compose.yml file** to comment out the Qdrant service but keep other services:
```yaml
# Comment out the Qdrant service
#qdrant:
#  image: qdrant/qdrant:latest
#  ...

# Update service connections to use host.docker.internal
app:
  environment:
    - QDRANT_URL=http://host.docker.internal:6333
```

## GPU Support for Embeddings Generation

The pipeline can use GPU acceleration for generating embeddings in the `sync_qdrant.py` script:

1. **Install PyTorch with CUDA support**:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
Choose the appropriate CUDA version (cu118, cu121, etc.) based on your system. Check with `nvidia-smi`.

2. **Enable GPU in configuration**:
```yaml
# In config/default.yaml
qdrant:
  gpu_enabled: true  # Enable GPU for vector operations
  gpu_device: 0      # GPU device index (0 for first GPU)
```

3. **Verify GPU detection** by checking script output when running:
```
Using GPU for embeddings: cuda:0
```

## Notes

- **Python Versions**: 
  - Docker containers use `python:3.11-slim`
  - Local development 'requires' Python ‚â•3.11 as specified in pyproject.toml
  - All dependencies are managed through pyproject.toml for consistent environments

- **Data Persistence**:
  - All persistent data (MongoDB, Neo4j, Qdrant) is stored in Docker volumes
  - PDF files are stored in the configured local directory

- **Development Approach**:
  - Either use the Python virtual environment with `python -m` commands
  - Or use Docker Compose for containerized execution
  - Both methods use the same configuration and produce consistent results

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymongo'`, ensure you have activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies.
- For Docker issues, ensure Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient permissions.

---

## External Tools for Data Exploration

The following tools are recommended for exploring the data outside the pipeline:

### MongoDB
- **MongoDB Compass** - A GUI for MongoDB that allows you to explore databases, collections, and documents
- Download: [https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- Connection string: `mongodb://localhost:27017/onfig` (when connecting to the Docker container)

### Neo4j
- **Neo4j Desktop** - A complete development environment for Neo4j projects
- Download: [https://neo4j.com/download/](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- Or use the Neo4j Browser at: http://localhost:7474/ (default credentials: neo4j/password)

### Qdrant
- **Qdrant Web UI** - A built-in web interface for exploring vector collections
- Access at: http://localhost:6333/dashboard when Qdrant is running
- Also consider **Qdrant Cloud Console** for more advanced features if you're using Qdrant Cloud

These tools provide graphical interfaces to explore, query, and visualize the data stored in each component of the pipeline.
