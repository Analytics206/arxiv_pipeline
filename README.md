# ArXiv Research Pipeline

ðŸ§  ArXiv Local AI Research Pipeline
A modular, fully local, open-source pipeline for fetching, structuring, and exploring AI research papers from arXiv.org. It allows offline graph-based and semantic search through MongoDB, Neo4j, and Qdrant using Hugging Face embeddings. All services run in Docker for easy, consistent local deployment.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Local-first: Everything runs offlineâ€”no cloud dependencies.

arXiv Ingestion: Fetch papers from the cs.AI category (configurable).

MongoDB Storage: Stores structured and raw metadata.

Graph Representation: Neo4j graph database captures relationships between papers, authors, and categories.

Semantic Embeddings: Embeds text using Hugging Face models, stored in Qdrant for similarity search.

Configurable & Modular: Centralized settings let you switch categories, models, and components.

Containerized: Fully Dockerized for isolated, repeatable setup.

ðŸ“¦ System Components
| Component             | Purpose                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Ingestion Service** | Fetches papers using arXiv Atom XML API      |
| **MongoDB**           | Stores raw and normalized metadata           |
| **Neo4j**             | Stores the author-paper-category graph       |
| **Qdrant**            | Stores vector embeddings for semantic search |
| **Config Manager**    | Central config for category, limits, model   |
| **Logger**            | Tracks events, errors, and skipped entries   |
| **Docker Compose**    | Brings it all together for local use         |


A local, platform-independent pipeline for processing research papers from arXiv.org.

## Setup Instructions

This project works on both Windows and Ubuntu/Linux environments.

---

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.9+ (Python 3.11 recommended)
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for fast Python dependency management)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)

---

### Installation (Local, Non-Docker)

#### Linux/macOS/WSL:
```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x scripts/setup_uv.sh

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup_uv.sh

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Run the setup script
.\scripts\setup_uv.ps1

# Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### Running the Pipeline Locally

```bash
python -m src.pipeline.run_pipeline --config config/default.yaml
```

---

### Dockerized Deployment

1. **Build and start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   docker-compose down
   
2. **(Optional) Rebuild the app service after code changes:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build app
   ```
   OR better option

   docker compose up -d app 
   docker compose logs -f app

3. **Access MongoDB, Neo4j, and Qdrant via their exposed ports.**

---
docker compose up --build sync-neo4j

$env:MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/onfig"
python src/utils/download_pdfs.py

---
### Configuration

- Edit `config/default.yaml` to change categories, fetch limits, or database settings.


---

### Notes

- The default Python version for Docker is now `python:3.10-slim`.
- All persistent data (MongoDB, Neo4j, Qdrant) is stored in Docker volumes.
- For development, use the local virtual environment; for production or multi-service orchestration, use Docker Compose.

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymongo'`, ensure you have activated your virtual environment and installed dependencies.
- For Docker issues, ensure Docker Desktop is running and you have sufficient permissions.
