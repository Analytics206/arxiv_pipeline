# ðŸ“˜ Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Name: ArXiv Local AI Research Pipeline

## 1. Overview
A modular, offline-capable pipeline that fetches and stores research papers from arXiv.org, beginning with the cs.AI category. Data will be structured in MongoDB, converted into a graph in Neo4j, and embedded into vector space using a Hugging Face model for indexing and search in Qdrant. The architecture is entirely local and open source. **All services will be containerized using Docker for local deployment and consistency.**

## 2. Goals
- Store and explore AI research papers with rich metadata.
- Create local-first infrastructure for graph-based and semantic exploration.
- Use modular components to allow category/model switching.
- Maintain all components and data sources within a single codebase.
- Use Docker containers to ensure repeatable local development and isolation of services.
