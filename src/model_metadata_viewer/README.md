# Model Metadata Viewer

A web-based tool to explore and compare machine learning models from Hugging Face and Ollama, integrated into the ArXiv Pipeline project.

## Overview

The Model Metadata Viewer provides a user-friendly interface to browse, search, and filter machine learning models from different sources. It's designed to work seamlessly with the ArXiv Pipeline's microservices architecture.

### Supported Model Sources

- **Hugging Face Models**: Public models from the Hugging Face Hub
- **Ollama Installed Models**: Models currently installed in your local Ollama instance
- **Ollama Available Models**: Models available for download from the Ollama library

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`
- For Ollama models: A running Ollama server (for installed models)
- For Hugging Face models: Internet connection to fetch model data

## Project Structure

```
src/
  model_metadata_viewer/
    model_metadata_viewer.html  # Web interface
    open_models_data.json       # Generated by load_huggingface_metadata.py
    ollama_models_data.json     # Generated by load_ollama_metadata.py
    ollama_available_models.json # Generated by load_ollama_all_metadata.py
  utils/
    load_huggingface_metadata.py
    load_ollama_metadata.py
    load_ollama_all_metadata.py
```

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. Generate the metadata files (see below)

## Generating Metadata Files

### 1. Hugging Face Models

```bash
python -m src.utils.load_huggingface_metadata
```

This will create `open_models_data.json` in the `model_metadata_viewer` directory with metadata for public Hugging Face models.

### 2. Ollama Installed Models

Make sure your Ollama server is running, then:

```bash
python -m src.utils.load_ollama_metadata
```

This will create `ollama_models_data.json` with metadata for your locally installed Ollama models.

### 3. Ollama Available Models

```bash
python -m src.utils.load_ollama_all_metadata
```

This will create `ollama_available_models.json` with metadata for all models available in the Ollama library.

## Using the Viewer

1. Open `src/model_metadata_viewer/model_metadata_viewer.html` in a web browser
2. Use the dropdown to select the model source
3. Search and filter models as needed

### Key Features

- **Search**: Find models by name or ID with real-time filtering
- **Filter**: 
  - Filter Hugging Face models by pipeline type
  - Filter Ollama models by size (small <4GB, medium 4-20GB, large 20GB+)
- **Sorting**: Sort models by benchmark scores (Hugging Face only)
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Offline**: Once data is downloaded, works without internet connection

## Integration with ArXiv Pipeline

The Model Metadata Viewer is designed to work with the ArXiv Pipeline's microservices architecture. It can be accessed through the main web interface or used as a standalone tool.

## Development

### Adding New Model Sources

To add a new model source:

1. Create a new Python script in `src/utils/` to fetch the model metadata
2. Save the output as JSON in the `model_metadata_viewer` directory
3. Update the web interface to support the new source

### Styling

The viewer uses Bootstrap 5 for styling. Custom styles can be added to the `<style>` section in the HTML file.

## Troubleshooting

- If models don't load, check the browser's console for errors
- Ensure the JSON files are properly formatted and accessible
- Make sure CORS is properly configured if accessing the viewer from a web server
